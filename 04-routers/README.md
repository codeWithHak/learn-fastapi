# API Router in FastAPI

## Why API Router?

When we develop big profuction ready projects we would have multiple APIs, but if we keep all APIs in one directory our code will get messy and it will be very hard to read.
So we divide our APIs into different files using API Router to make our code readable and developer friendly.
